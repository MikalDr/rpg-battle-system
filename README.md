# RPG BattleSystem
This project is supposed to be a recreation of the battle systems seen in old school RPGs.
As of now the game is functional in a bare-bones version. You can pick between three fighters, and
fight using these. There is a simple gameloop which needs some polishing.

The end goal is to have a fully functional terminal game with pixel-art graphics via the Brick library.
And a satisfying gameloop

# Game Loop
- Fight
- Rewards
- Organize
- Repeat 

# Goals
